# Algolist

Algolist is a mobile application developed as part of a recruitment test project. The app demonstrates the use of various Android libraries and technologies to build a robust and modern Android application.

## Libraries Used

- **UI Design**:
  - **SSP (Scaled Size Pixel)**: Used for handling scalable text sizes to ensure consistency across different screen sizes.
  - **SDP (Scale-independent Pixels)**: Ensures that the app's UI elements are proportionate and look consistent on various screen densities.

- **Navigation**:
  - **Navigation Component**: Facilitates in-app navigation, including fragment transactions and UI updates in response to navigation actions.

- **Lifecycle Management**:
  - **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
  - **LiveData**: Provides observable data that is lifecycle-aware.
  - **Lifecycle Runtime**: Integrates lifecycle-aware components for better lifecycle management.

- **Dependency Injection**:
  - **Dagger-Hilt**: Simplifies dependency injection by providing a standard way to incorporate Dagger in Android applications.

- **Database Management**:
  - **Room**: Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to manage local database access more effectively.

- **Coroutines**:
  - **Kotlin Coroutines**: Handles asynchronous operations and concurrency, improving performance and responsiveness.

- **Logging**:
  - **Timber**: A logging library that simplifies logging and provides better control over logging output.

- **Animations**:
  - **Lottie**: Supports smooth and rich animations using JSON files, enhancing the visual appeal of the app.

## Features

- **Scalable UI**: Ensures consistent and accessible design across various devices.
- **Efficient Navigation**: Streamlined navigation between different parts of the application.
- **Lifecycle-aware Components**: Manages app data and lifecycle events efficiently.
- **Dependency Injection**: Simplifies the management and injection of dependencies.
- **Local Data Storage**: Robust local database management using Room.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handles background tasks and asynchronous operations seamlessly.
- **Enhanced Logging**: Provides detailed and controlled logging for debugging purposes.
- **Rich Animations**: Utilizes Lottie for smooth and engaging animations.
